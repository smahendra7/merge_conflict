"""
suggestion_generator.py

Generates AI-powered improvement suggestions for PR validation warnings.

Two public functions:
    generate_description_suggestion(pr_title, pr_body, diff)
        -> str   (a suggested PR description)

    generate_comment_suggestion(file, line, comment, code, reason)
        -> str   (a suggested corrected comment)

Both call Groq. On any failure (API error, timeout, parse error) they
return a safe human-readable fallback string so the caller can always
display *something* useful without hard-failing the pipeline.

The developer has submitted a PR whose description needs improvement.
Based on the PR title, the existing (possibly empty or unclear) description,
and the actual code changes shown in the diff, write a clear and concise
PR description that:
- Explains the overall purpose and intent of this PR in plain language.
- Summarises what was changed at a high level (no need to list every file).
- Is accurate to the actual code changes shown.
- Is written as a developer would write it (first or third person, professional tone).
- Is 2–5 sentences long — no bullet lists unless naturally appropriate.

PR Title: {pr_title or "(no title)"}

Existing PR Description (may be empty, vague, or inaccurate):
{pr_body or "(no description provided)"}

Code Diff (actual changes):
{truncated_diff or "(no diff available)"}

no "Here is the suggested description:" prefix. Just the description itself."""
